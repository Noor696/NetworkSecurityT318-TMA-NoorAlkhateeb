## Question 3: 
--------------------

### Encryption using a block cipher 

**a.** You have a (single block) ciphertext message (in binary): 1000 1011 0111 1010.Use your Student ID number to obtain a 16-bit key as follows: Key (in decimal) = ID mod 65536. Using Simplified AES (S-AES) manually decrypt the ciphertext using your key. You must show and explain all steps in your decryption

**b.**	Compare AES to DES. For each of the following elements of DES, indicate the comparable element in AES or explain why it is not needed in AES.

   1. XOR of the f function output with the left half of the block
   
   2. The f function

   3. Permutation P

   4. Swapping of halves of the block
